These 4 pages of website are developed by Anna Lu 
as an application demo for Front-End ###, adopted from website: http://www.humanlongevity.com/products/hliq-whole-genome/. 
Related information and pictured were gathered via ### official website.

* the mock-logo used here was designed using this website:
https://www.tailorbrands.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=769321668&utm_content=47346941984&utm_term=logo%20design&gclid=Cj0KEQjwy4zLBRCOg6-4h6vs3cUBEiQAN-yzfiXBm9ejhCeUDRd_yPY6kYFzZv2UBowYlXMHK7hI7IIaApLn8P8HAQ

Please help me to protect copyright. Cannot thank you more!
I left some inline text of my name to protect myself, apologize a head for any possible interruption.

To view the pages, google chrome is recommended. 
(in real working settings, all kinds and versions of main stream browser must be tested before 
launching a new website, so people tend to use commercialized theme and then revise it; 
while this project is done totally by head-coding).

list of html file:
1. main-demo-page-AnnaXLU.html 
	main page, with most real clickable items on it, and linked to other 3 pages. 
	real clickable/hoverable elements:
	1) fixed navigation bar with shuffle animation;
	2) links beneath product menu;
	3) links below the head picture (not very precise, need to improve);
	4) links to make call and send email;

2. secondary-demo-tumor-AnnaXRL.html
	less clickable/hoverable elements.
	I chose this part as secondary demo because it is based on steps, which makes 
    presenting information much easier.
	displays another design idea by adding and making use of head lines.

3. LanguageProcessing.html
	only nav bar clickable.
	to support the first 2 pages.
4. DNASequencing.html
    only nav bar clickable.
	to support the first 2 pages.

Things to improve:
1. links below the head picture (not very precise, need to improve);
2. scrollable back img cover (do not have it yet);
3. navigation bar can be implemented more neatly;
4. mobile responsiveness (using CSS; do not have it yet; 
   in real-life it is included in commercialized theme, so we actually do
   not have to worry about it too much);
5. social media is not connected yet (not hard to implement with accounts);
6. not bilingual (normally commercialized theme and plugins can handle this, 
   so no worry);
7. SEO features (normally commercialized theme and plugins can handle this, 
   so no worry)
We can always do better!

Design files:
I have them on lucid chart

The thing I like in the reference webpage is the bleeding heading image, 
also it implies the company's location; 
What I dislike is the theme color, so I changed it from greenish to more blue,
which, for me, is of more energy;
The side picture can be used as a structure for info flow, so I enlarged it
as background;
a search bar is added, because people tend to find answers by themselves, 
rather than follow your presentation;
Also the information flow in the reference webpage is somehow overwhelming -
too many information and I did not see the logic flow, but for promotion 
purpose, it successfully emphasized the relationship between science and health, 
and has enough resource/choices to persuade people to contact. 


Thank you.
